# Snake-Game
This is Snake game I made using turtle module in python. The project is bit older, so there will be few mistakes.

There are 5 files, u will need them all (excluding README).
You control snake using WASD.

P.S.: You will need python and turtle module installed(or some python enviroment like pycharm or whatever).
